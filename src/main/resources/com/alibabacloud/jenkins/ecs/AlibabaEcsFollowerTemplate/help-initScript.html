    The Init script is a shell script that runs on the newly started follower node instance before Jenkins starts to start the follower node.<br>
    This is also a good place to install other packages needed for building and testing. <br/>
    Example: <br/>
    <code>
        #!/bin/bash <br/>
        sudo yum install -y net-tools
    </code>
