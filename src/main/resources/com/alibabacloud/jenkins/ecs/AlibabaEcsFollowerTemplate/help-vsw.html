    Virtual switch ID, a switch (vSwitch) is a basic network device that forms a VPC and is used to connect different cloud resource instances.
    A VPC is a region-level resource. A VPC cannot span regions, but includes all the availability zones in the region to which it belongs.
    You can create one or more switches within each Availability Zone to divide the subnets.<br>
