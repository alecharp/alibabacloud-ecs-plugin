    The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this node.default: 4<br>
    A good value to start with would be the number of CPU cores on the machine(see the "Instance Types and
    Specifications" chapter of <a href="https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/108399.html">"Elastic Cloud Server Product
    Introduction"</a> get the cpu number).<br>
    Setting a higher value would cause each build to take longer, but could increase the overall throughput. For
    example, one build might be CPU-bound, while a second build running at the same time might be I/O-bound â€” so the
    second build could take advantage of the spare I/O capacity at that moment.

    For the master, set the number of executors to zero to prevent it from executing builds locally. Note: master will
    always be able to run flyweight tasks including Pipeline's top-level task.
